<h1>Webaim screenreader user survey</h1>
<p>6 Jun 2012</p>
<p>The annual screenreader user survey is out, at <a href="http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/">http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/</a></p>

<p>If you've not seen it before, it is definitely worth the five minutes it will take you to scan through.  Its results contradict a lot of received wisdom about screenreader behaviours, and clarify some common uncertainties.</p>
<p>
Main takeaways:
<ul>
	<li>Screenereader users love headings for navigating around a page</li>

	<li>1.4% donâ€™t have JS on, so your biggest user base without JS is going to be search bots.</li>

	<li>82.7% update their software</li>

	<li>JAWS is still dominant, but decreasing due to uptake in NVDA (free) and VoiceOver (Mac, iOS)</li>

	<li>CAPTCHA is still a massive pain. Only Flash is worse for difficulty</li>

	<li>Quite a lot are using mobiles with screenreaders</li>
</ul>
