<h1>A better application cache manifest</h1>

<p>24 February 2011</p>

<p>I've recently been messing around with offline application caching.  At a simple static level it is pretty basic, but once you start thinking about what might actually happen in real life it gets a lot more ugly.</p>

<p>The following sources got me started with offline caching in the first place.  If you need more background to what application cache is, you should read these first.</p>

</ul>
<p>My main problem with it is that every time I make a change to my files, I have to go into my cache.manifest file and update a comment somewhere.  Why? Because the application cache is checked for updates first.  If there are no updates, it just stops.  It doesn't check any of the underlying files for updates.</p>

<p>That's efficient in terms of client-server communication by reducing the amount of calls to check whether cached versions can be used or need updated, but its also really dumb, and a nuisance to work with.  You start relying on people to remember on these little jobs, and that introduces a risk of human error.  It's not an acceptable risk because it is an avoidable risk.</p>

<p>Luckily we can use server-side technology to generate our cache manifests and grab the file update timestamp.  Here's what I've learned thus far:
<ol>
	<li>the manifest attribute on the html element doesn't have to point to a *.manifest file.  It can point to a manifest.php file (for example).</li>
	<li>in the dynamic page, set your header to serve up the right mime type.  In PHP, this is
<code>&lt;? php header("Content-Type: text/cache-manifest;charset=utf-8"); ?&gt;</code></li>
	<li>find the most recently updated file date and echo it out in a comment. If there's not been a change, the comment will remain the same in the generated code as it is in the cached version.   In my example below I'm statically setting which files I want to be in the cache. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jonathanstark/offline-application-cache"> Jonathan Stark shows a way of going through the file system to cache all files</a> if you'd rather.  You'd just add the timestamp bits in where required.</li>
</ol>

CACHE MANIFEST
NETWORK:

CACHE:
&lt;?php
	$cache_mod = 0;
	foreach($cache_files as $f){
		echo &quot;$f \n&quot;;
		$last_mod = filemtime($f);
		if($last_mod &gt; $cache_mod){

	}
	unset($f);

FALLBACK:
