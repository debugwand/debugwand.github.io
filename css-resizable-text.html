<h1>CSS Strategies for resizable text</h1>

<p>10 September 2013</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-scale">WCAG guidelines on resizable text</a> state that you should be able to scale text by 200%.</p>

<p>How to test:</p>
<p>In Firefox, got to View -&gt; Zoom -&gt; Zoom Text Only.  Then when you are back in your page, zoom up to 200% by pressing Ctrl + 6 times.</p>

<p>Possible problems that happen when only text gets bigger:
<ul>
<li>Text that wraps underneath itself has too little space between the letters.  You've set your line-heights in px.</li>
	<li>using height which causes text to get cut when it overflows that height</li>
	<li>Items lie on top of one another, because you're using absolute positioning</li>
<li>text stops sitting on a particular background colour and becomes hard to see (or just looks untidy)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
SCENARIO: I have an element that must be at least x pixels tall, but could grow larger if I put more text in there<br />
SOLUTION: use min-height rather than height, remember that older IE will treat height as min-height so use your .ie6 styles or whatever you are using to set it seperately
</p>
<p>
SCENARIO: I have an element that must be no more or less than a specific height<br />
SOLUTION: set the height in ems rather than px and the box will grow with the text resizing
</p>
<p>
SCENARIO: text is sitting on top of other text or items and is illegible<br />
SOLUTION: rework the layout using floats or relative positioning, negative margins, or if you have fixed dimensions for your absolutely positioned item (e.g. a close icon on a lightbox), style your surrounding boxes so that their margins sit on the area where the absolutely positioned item is. At worst you may have to use a bit of JS to refine the position (e.g. you need to align something to the bottom of another element) but that is mixing styling rules with behaviour rules.
</p>
<p>
SCENARIO: my text no longer sits on a coloured background, I've run out of background image<br />
SOLUTION: rebuild so that the background surrounds the content section of your box, which has a background color.  The background adjusts as the size of the content grows and shrinks because it sits around it rather than under it<br />
LEAST DESIRABLE SOLUTION: wrap your text in an element that gets given a background color
</p>
<p>
SCENARIO: there's no longer enough space between the lines of text<br />
SOLUTION: don't set line-height in pixels, set it in ems, and make less use of them because as you use relative units, you'll find that they are a pain to maintain when they start getting inherited.
